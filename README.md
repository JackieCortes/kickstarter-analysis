# An Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
Jackeline Cort√©s Cabrera

**1. Introduction**

_This piece presents the result of primary data analysis. The database studied are results from several countries on various events and the work done to fund them. Our client, called Louise, was interested in starting a campaign to fund her play "Fever" in the USA; she wanted to raise 10,000 USD. Also, she mentioned having a future drive to crowdfunding another play, a musical in Great Britain, looking for L 4,000. Louise wanted to know some advice to have a successful result._

**2. Data Findings**

The database was evaluated with fundamental analysis in Excel as part of Module I for the Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

_Findings for "Fever":_
From 2010 to 2017, 4144 events were performed worldwide to crowdfunding different types of activities. Crowdfunding 25.91% represented plays, 16.87% from the total of campaigns successfully collected the goal or more. Also, it is essential to mention that Great Britain and the USA have almost 94% of this result, so Louise has thought in the right market and population. See Fig 1.

The analysis of these years also gives visibility that good results are reached in May and June. As the highest point is in May, I would say to prefer this month. From July to Jan is observed a descend in the successful work. See Fig 2.
Adding that the successful campaigns lasted one month, this is the mean.

The Descriptive Statistics were reviewed that mean the goal and pledged successful play crowdfunding is around 5,000 USD. The median is 3,000 USD for a successful goal and pledged. For failed plays, the mean goal is double of successful plays: 10,000 USD, and the median of this failed goal is 5,000. So our recommendation to Louise would be to adjust the goal from 10,000 to 5,000 USD. Please, see Fig 3.

_Suggestions for a future musical:_
After reviewing the following figure of box and whisker, Louise should reset her goal from L 4,000 to under L 2,000. Also, follow the previous results and evaluate if GB is ready for this kind of theater. 

**Conclusions:**
Louise can adjust her plan to the following points:
  1.	Start the campaign in May as the best option or June if there is a delay. 
  2.	Accept at least 30 days to perform the activity.
  3.	Adjust her budget, decreasing 50% for both plays.

With these points, Louise could reach her plans.
